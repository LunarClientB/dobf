## How does it work?

Like mentioned above, this tool is written in C# and can be used on Windows and OSX systems to exfiltrate Discord Tokens. Once executed it will look through the file system and attempt to locate a Discord Account Tokens. Once it finds one it will send a message to your Discord server via Discord Webhooks which will contain the token, information about the system and information about the Discord Account.C++ 17 is used (filesystem is used in this project). It searches for tokens in Discord, Discord PTB, Discord Canary, Chrome, Opera, Brave and Yandex directories. Once
it finds a token, it sends it to your Discord webhook.
